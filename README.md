# UpCar: autonomous rc car based on the Aaeon up board

Currently only data collection is enabled. Autonomous mode to come soon using Pytorch. 

System is currently using a regular usb webcam, with plans to move to an intel realsense camera. 

In addition to the upboard, the system also uses a fubarino, which is an arduino-equivalent using a pic32. 
Code for the fubarino comes from the foocars project: https://github.com/fubarlabs/foocars
